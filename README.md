# bassTicket
This is bassTicket (properly pronounced as bass in music). Currently Open Source, I would like this to pack all of the features of the best paid ticketing systems, but for free.
This is based on PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. CKEditor is the editor being used by the ticketing system to allow users to have inline images. The design of the site has been created using Bootstrap Studio.
I am open to all improvements. Please feel free to message me, add issues, etc.

If you would like to use this software, please inform me. I will allow people to use this software free of charge as long as you ASK FIRST. As there is no liscnese, you cannot use this software in a commerical application (again ask, I may be willing to come to an agreement for commercial applications. Most likely it will still be free, just with some strings attatched). Personal use...... Just ask first. Thank you.
