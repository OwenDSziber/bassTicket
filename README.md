# bassTicket
This is bassTicket (properly pronounced as bass in music). Currently Open Source, I would like this to pack all of the features of the best paid ticketing systems, but for free.
This is based on PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. CKEditor is the editor being used by the ticketing system to allow users to have inline images. The design of the site has been created using Bootstrap Studio.
I am open to all improvements. Please feel free to message me, add issues, etc.

I am setting this up currently. It does require a funtioning webserver, and I will include the SQL for the tables I used to import into PHPMYADMIN.
